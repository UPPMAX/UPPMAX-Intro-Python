# Variables, expressions and statements

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    * Get the type of an object
    * Create a variable
    * Use a variable

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    * Learners have worked with variables
    * Learners understand the purpose of variables
    * Learners have obtained the data type of a variable
    * Learners have heard about what a data type is

    Lesson plan:

    Exercise 1:

    * 5 mins: prior knowledge
    * 5 mins: presentation
    * 15 mins: challenge
    * 5 mins: feedback

    Exercise 2 and 3:

    * 5 mins: prior knowledge
    * 5 mins: presentation
    * 15 mins: challenge
    * 5 mins: feedback

    Exercise 4:

    * 5 mins: prior knowledge
    * 5 mins: presentation
    * 15 mins: challenge
    * 5 mins: feedback

## Overview

In any non-trivial calculation, we want to let our computer remember
things, such as the content of a data file, or the parameters/settings
we use in our program. Variables allows one to make a computer
store ('remember') information. Here we use our first simple variables.

Also we practice converting an equation and a mathematical problem
to Python code. We will discover the helpful modulo operator.
