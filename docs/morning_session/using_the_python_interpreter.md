# Using the Python interpreter

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    * To be able to login to Rackham autonomously
    * To be able to load a Python version autonomously
    * To be able to run a minimal Python program autonomously

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    * Learners have used the UPPMAX documentation
    * Learners have used the Python interpreter
    * Learners have loaded Python using the module system

    Lesson plan:

    * 5 mins: prior knowledge
    * 5 mins: presentation
    * 15 mins: challenge
    * 5 mins: feedback

## Overview

To develop code in Python on the UPPMAX clusters, one needs to:

- Login to Rackham, to be on an UPPMAX cluster
- Load the Python module, to be able to use a modern Python interpreter
- Use the Python interpreter, to run Python code

Luckily, UPPMAX has documentation that should allow you to do so autonomously.

These exercises will ensure you are able to run a minimal Python program.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: login to Rackham

 * Learning objective: to be able to login to Rackham autonomously

Login to Rackham from your terminal. 
This is described at the UPPMAX page 'Login to Rackham' [here](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/login_rackham/).

### Exercise 2: load the Python module

 * Learning objective: to be able to load a Python version autonomously


Load Python version 3.10.8. 
This is described at the UPPMAX pages on Python [here](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/python/).

### Exercise 3: write a 'Hello world' program

 * Learning objective: to be able to run a minimal Python program autonomously

Start Python and write a 'Hello world' program.
This is described at the UPPMAX pages on Python programming [here](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/python_programming/#use-the-python-interpreter)
