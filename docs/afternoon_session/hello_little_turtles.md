## Overview


## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Fail at running a first program

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Rehearse creating a script
    - Try to import a Python package
    - Observe errors when a package is absent

Read the following sections of [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html):

 * 3.1. Our first turtle program

Copy-paste the first script in that section to a script.

Run the script and verify it will not run. Does the error message make sense?

### Exercise 2: Running a first program

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Import a Python package
    - Search for an UPPMAX module that needs to be loaded
    - Run a script that requires an UPPMAX module to be loaded

Now we try to make this script work!

Read: 

- [the UPPMAX documentation 'Loading Python packages'](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/python/#loading-python-packages)
- [the UPPMAX documentation 'Modules'](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/modules/)

Now, try to get the script to work. 

When running the code, there should be a visible pop-up window. If not, 
re-read [the UPPMAX documentation page 'Login to Rackham'](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/login_rackham/)
and enable X-forwarding.
