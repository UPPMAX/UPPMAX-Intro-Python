# Files

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Have read a file
    - Have created a file

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    * Learners have read a file
    * Learners have created a file

    Lesson plan:

    * 5 mins: prior knowledge
    * 5 mins: presentation
    * 15 mins: challenge
    * 5 mins: feedback

## Overview

Most programmers need to work on data and produce some result.
In Python, we -of course- can read from files and write to files.
Here we do just that.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: create a simple text file

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Create a simple text file

Read the following sections of [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html):

- 13.1. About files
- 13.2. Writing our first file

Then do:

- Put the code at the top of 13.2 in a Python script
- Run that code
- Verify that it works as expected


### Exercise 2: create a simple text file


!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Read a simple text file
    - Repeat creating a file
    - Practice to search the internet how to reverse the order of text lines

Read the following sections of [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html):

- 13.4. Turning a file into a list of lines

Consider searching for ['Python reverse order'](https://lmddgtfy.net/?q=python%20reverse%20order),
as you will need to do this in the exercise.

Then do:

- Exercise 13.11.1


### Exercise 3: working with an input file

!!!- info "Learning objectives"

    - Import a Python package
    - Practice to search for an UPPMAX module that needs to be loaded
    - Get a script that requires an UPPMAX module to be loaded to work

Now we try to make this script work!

Read: 

- [the UPPMAX documentation 'Loading Python packages'](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/python/#loading-python-packages)
- [the UPPMAX documentation 'Modules'](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/cluster_guides/modules/)

Now, try to get the script to work. 

When running the code, there should be a visible pop-up window. If not, 
re-read [the UPPMAX documentation page 'Login to Rackham'](http://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/login_rackham/)
and enable X-forwarding.

???- question "Need more hints?"

    The exercise is about *practicing* to search for an UPPMAX module,
    hence giving away the answer makes this session useless.

    However, if you feel stuck too much, 
    you can watch a video in which this exercise is done
