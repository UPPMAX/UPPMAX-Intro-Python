# Prerequisites

Before the course, you must have done these *four* things:

- Prerequisite 1/4: You have registered at our registration form at [here](https://forms.gle/kzazFVBBo6HPHfub9)

- Prerequisite 2/4: A user account on a Swedish academic HPC cluster

???- question "How can I check if I have this?"

    When you can login at [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/).

    It should look similar to this:

???- question "How to get this?"

    Register at [https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/).

???- question "What if I have a problem here?"

    Contact `richel.bilderbeek@uppmax.uu.se`

- Prerequisite 3/4: Be able to login to an HPC cluster using SSH

???- question "How can I check if I have this?"

    This depends on the HPC cluster you are using.
    For UPPMAX's Rackham, it look similar to this:

???- question "Is it OK if I can login using other methods?"

    Probably: yes

    - Using a website: yes
    - Using a local ThinLinc client: yes

???- question "How to get this?"

    Follow the instructions of your favorite HPC center
    or [the UPPMAX instruction](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/login_rackham_console_password/)

???- question "What if I have a problem here?"

    Contact `richel.bilderbeek@uppmax.uu.se`

- Prerequisite 4/4: have a good Zoom setup

???- question "How can I check if I have this?"

    - You are in a room where you can talk
    - You talk into a (standalone or headset) microphone
    - Others can clearly hear you when you talk
    - Others can see you
    - You can hear others clearly when they talk

???- question "How to get this?"

    - Find/schedule/book a room where you can talk
    - Buy a simple headset

???- question "What if I don't have this? Is that OK?"

    No.

    You will feel left out, as the course in highly interactive.
    It would be weird to the other learners.

???- question "What if I have social anxiety?"

    Sorry to hear that. In this course, it is OK to give a wrong
    answer or to say 'I do not know'. This is what a former
    learner had to say on this:

    > As a learner, you do not want to be berated when giving an answer.
    > Richel tries to gently deal with a wrong answer and he does this great
    >
    > A learner from this course ([source](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/evaluations/2024_01/))

    You are welcome to try and leave anytime you want.
    The course material is made for self-study too, with videos
    for all exercises.
    Do fill in the evaluation when you leave early :-)
