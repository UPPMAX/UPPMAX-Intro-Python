The course was widened in scope from UPPMAX-only to NAISS-wide,
two hours before a newsletter needed to be sent out.
I prepared the text for a newsletter, assuming I will get the course
material in shape later.

First I will get the website into good shape, before transitioning
the content to be NAISS-wide.
Done! [Version 2.3.1](https://github.com/UPPMAX/uppmax_intro_python/releases/tag/v2.3.1)
builds cleanly!
