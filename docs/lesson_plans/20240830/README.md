# Lesson plan

I've already taught using this material once.
The lesson plans are in the top of the material
of each session, hence no need to write it here.

I will use the same exercise procedure as
[here](https://richelbilderbeek.github.io/teaching/exercise_procedures/duos_in_breakout_rooms/),
but for groups of 3,
as this worked well on Day 1.
