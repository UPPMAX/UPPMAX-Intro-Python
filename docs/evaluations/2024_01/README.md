## Anonymous evalations

[Anonymous evalation results that were clearly directed to Richel](python_by_richel.md).

## Informal evalations

This evalations had the form of an informal dialogue.

- From 1 learner

I had some questions, for example 'What is the interactive node
going to do with my output?'. It is great that we practiced this!

If no video, the teacher cannot see when learners are lost:
great idea to turn cameras on for that too!

- lovely
- fresh
- kept audience awake
- As a learner, you do not want to be berated when giving an answer.
  Richel tries to gently deal with a wrong answer and he does this great
- cameras on is great: else learners feel alone
- in a gentle way, Richel makes people feel that this is serious:
  there is a schedule, there are exercises and we are going to do it!
- breaks are great: two hours, 1.5 hours is tough!
- interrupting an exercise for a break is fine
