# Reflection

- The learners were nearly twice as fast than the cohort of 2024-01-18:

Time |Start of section
-----|--------------------------------
09:30|1. Use the Python script'
09:50|2. Way of the program'
10:15|3. Workking with Python scripts'
10:45|4. VET 1: variables
11:30|5. VET 2: operators
13:15|6. VET 3: user input
13:45|7. Hello little turtle
14:30|8. File I/O
?|9. Command-line arguments
?|10. Graphics
?|Functions -> no, send home!


This makes me wonder: can I stop earlier with them?

- Pro: reward for working hard
- Con: they expect a full day of work, I can give them a learning
  environment the full day

- [x] Weak prior of exercise VET 2: opererators
  - [x] Add better ones to course material
  - [x] I already did so, I just forgot to `git push`
- I feel there are too much splits in the sessions.
  Should I clump those together yes/no?
  Let's see if this comes up at the evaluation!
