I tried to make some contact with the learners, without success. My day of teaching is the fourth of a series of lessons and I felt the learners asymptotically approached coming in at 8:59 at each successive day.</p> <p>I started at 9:00 sharp. I took the time for the learners to turn on a camera. I told the learners how I will behave differently with a camera on or off.</p> <p>I lectured the presentation about myself, which is the least important thing of the course, so some learners could connect their camera. About 80%-95% of around 33 learners had a camera on after finishing the presentation.</p> <p>I started the first teaching cycle: 'What do you think about when you think about Python?', were I randomly asked learners. They knew I would, as that was in the presentation about me already. I took care to bend most answers that show a learner is not perfect into something more mild.</p> <p>I took time to discuss the workflow of how to do an exercise in pairs. My favorite part in theory was the way I would determine to move to a next exercise: (1) all learners start in pairs, (2) when a pair is done, they go to the main room, after which they are distributed over other rooms, (3) when two thirds of the students is in the main room, I close the Breakout rooms ruthlessly: (a) the remaining pairs have another minutes left, (b) the remainders are likely to catch up in the next cycle. (4) when all learners are back, ask answers to individual students and give feedback on those answers.</p> <p>The Feedback phase felt slow to me: I asked one learner per question, asked him/her to share the screen and try to do reproduce the answer again. Still, I knew 'Feedback' is the 10th most impactful intervention, which made me follow the plan.</p> <p>After the Feedback, I usually connected what we just learned to earlier knowledge again, using concept maps and repeat concepts. Also here: I know this is important to do.</p> <p>While the learners did their exercises, there was a lot of waiting for me. I needed to be in the main room, so I could move people around: sometimes, people would not go to a breakout room (for example, because they were not behind a computer at that time) or had a computer reboot or had multiple logins (e.g. a computer to share screen and a phone to share camera). Also, I sent the helpers to go through the rooms, due to which I had even less to do. It was quite dull for me. I did not want to do something else, to maintain focus.</p> <p>I commonly, but not always, instructed the helpers to do something like this: 'Go through rooms x to y to observe (1) the atmosphere of the room, (2) if the learners know what to do. Do not lecture the learners'. I am unsure if all helpers understood and I cannot check that either. Maybe next time ask:</p> <ul> <li>Q: What is the purpose of visiting the breakout rooms?</li> <li>A: To check if the learners can work and do so in a welcoming way</li> <li>Q: If, in a breakout room, the learners appear to be concentrated,   what do you do?</li> <li>A: Do not disturb and move to the next breakout room:   you've seen they can work</li> <li>Q: If, in a breakout room, two learners are discussing something.   They, however, have reached a wrong conclusion. What do you do?</li> <li>A: Do not disturb and move to the next breakout room:   you've seen they can work</li> <li>Q: If, in a breakout room, two learners have an unfriendly argument,   what do you do?</li> <li>A: Do something about this. This is up to you.   Either handle this yourself or ask me to take care of it. Always let me know</li> <li>Q: If, in a breakout room, two learners are discussing Pokemon,   what do you do?</li> <li>A: Do something about this to set them back to work in a friendly way</li> <li>Q: If, in a breakout room, only one learner has no camera, what do you do?</li> <li>A: Do not disturb and move to the next breakout room:   you have no evidence they cannot work</li> <li>Q: If, in a breakout room, both learners have no camera, what do you do?</li> <li>A: Do not disturb and move to the next breakout room:   you have no evidence they cannot work</li> <li>Q: If, in a breakout room, one or both learners ask a question to you.   What do you do?</li> <li>A: Determine if you should answer: have they discussed together already?   If yes, help them arrive at finding the right answer.   Only give a direct answer as a last option</li> </ul> <p>While the learners did their exercises, twice I went through all the breakout rooms anyways. I felt blind and the need to sample at least once or twice. I took care to go in each room with a neutral expression, say nothing, and leave with a visible thumbs up. Only rarely did I get questions. The questions were relevant to fix. I've seen mostly learners that were reading/programming in deep focus, or sharing a screen and talking.</p> <p>I followed the break schedule loyally, even when a break happened in the middle of an exercise. I already stated to the learners I would do that, as breaks are important.</p> <p>During the day, we did around 5 teaching cycles.</p> <p>I shortened the Challenge (i.e. exercise) about find the right UPPMAX module for a Python package: it is hard to get right and is more UPPMAX than Python (and Python is at the focus of this day). I told the learners why and showed them the YouTube video and encouraged them to watch it later: I wanted to move on to the next session.</p> <p>There was some dead space when 10 learners where in the main room, when all groups already have 1 extra helper, waiting for a remaining trio to finish. I told I would not to discuss the answer yet, but am open to any other questions. Some learners had some Python or UPPMAX questions, sometimes I asked for feedback about the book and its exercises.</p> <p>At 15:55 I interrupted the last cycle to repeat what we did and look at the course material that is also there. In the last minute, I thanked the group for being great to work with.</p> <p>At 16:00 sharp the learners left and I had a meeting with one of them: he is involved in teaching and I wanted to discuss teaching as colleagues. He stayed, Pavlin stayed too and we discussed teaching and mostly got feedback (see A2 below). Pavlin discovered that Zoom's random shuffle algorithm puts people with cameras in the first rooms! He discovered that due to this, there is a huge difference between the atmosphere in room 1 and 16: room 1 was the most fun, room 16 was colder. Pavlin felt the learners were having fun and being productive at the same time.</p> <p>At around 16:15 the day was over.</p> <p>I think the day was efficient and I feel most of the credits must go to the cooperative learners. On the other hand, I did plan to make it likely to get them to cooperate :-)</p>"},{"location":"reflections/20240118/#possible-improvements","title":"Possible improvements","text":"<p>[DONE] Split up the exercises for the block 'Variables, expressions and statement' in different pages: I intended to cut that up in three teaching cycles, as can be seen in the schedule.

For your convenience, the questions are copy-pasted below:</p> <p>1.12.1</p> <p>Write an English sentence with understandable semantics but incorrect syntax. Write another English sentence which has correct syntax but has semantic errors.</p> Answer <p>From the Wikipedia link: 'A syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters that is intended to be written in a particular programming language'.</p> <p>An English sentence with understandable logic but incorrect syntax:</p> <pre><code>One plus one is twoooooooo\n</code></pre> <p>A semantic error is also called a logic error, hence a sentence with correct syntax and semantic errors is:</p> <p>From here, where the sentence is attributed to Noam Chomsky:</p> <pre><code>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\n</code></pre> <p>From here:</p> <pre><code>My mother's white cat is black.\n</code></pre> <p>1.12.2</p> <p>Using the Python interpreter, type <code>1 + 2</code> and then hit return. Python evaluates this expression, displays the result, and then shows another prompt. <code>*</code> is the multiplication operator, and <code>**</code> is the exponentiation operator. Experiment by entering different expressions and recording what is displayed by the Python interpreter.</p> Answer <p>This is more about experimenting with the operators <code>+</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>**</code>. Here are some things to let the Python interpreter evaluate:</p> <pre><code>1+2\n1 + 2\n1*2\n2 * 3\n2**3\n</code></pre> <p>1.12.3</p> <p>Type <code>1 2</code> and then hit return. Python tries to evaluate the expression, but it can't because the expression is not syntactically legal. Instead, it shows the error message:</p> <pre><code>File \"&lt;interactive input&gt;\", line 1\n1 2\n  ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n</code></pre> <p>In many cases, Python indicates where the syntax error occurred, but it is not always right, and it doesn't give you much information about what is wrong.</p> <p>So, for the most part, the burden is on you to learn the syntax rules.</p> <p>In this case, Python is complaining because there is no operator between the numbers.</p> <p>See if you can find a few more examples of things that will produce error messages when you enter them at the Python prompt. Write down what you enter at the prompt and the last line of the error message that Python reports back to you.</p> Answer <p>This question is more about experimenting, armed with limited knowledge on <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>**</code> and <code>print</code>.</p> <p>Here are some of my favorites:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;  1\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1\n    1\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print 1\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1\n    print 1\n    ^^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print(...)?\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print 1 + 1\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1\n    print 1 + 1\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^\nSyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'.

Python executes this, which has the effect of printing the letters h-e-l-l-o. Notice that the quotation marks that you used to enclose the string are not part of the output. Now type \"hello\" and describe your result. Make notes of when you see the quotation marks and when you don\u2019t.</p> Answer <p>Here are the four combinations of using <code>print</code> yes/no and using single/double quotes:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(\"Hello\")\nHello\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print('Hello')\nHello\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \"Hello\"\n'Hello'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hello'\n'Hello'\n</code></pre> <p>A correct conclusion is:</p> <ul> <li>When using <code>print</code>, any type of quotes is removed</li> <li>When not using <code>print</code>, the word is printed in single quotes</li> </ul> <p>1.12.5</p> <p>Type <code>cheese</code> without the quotation marks. The output will look something like this:</p> <pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;interactive input&gt;\", line 1, in ?\nNameError: name 'cheese' is not defined\n</code></pre> <p>This is a run-time error; specifically, it is a <code>NameError</code>, and even more specifically, it is an error because the name <code>cheese</code> is not defined. If you don't know what that means yet, you will soon.</p> Answer <p>This is more of an explanation. Indeed:</p> <pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; cheese\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nNameError: name 'cheese' is not defined\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"sessions/the_way_of_the_program/#exercise-2-running-a-python-script","title":"Exercise 2: Running a Python script","text":"<p>Learning objectives</p> <ul> <li>create a Python script</li> <li>run a Python script</li> <li>use a text editor on an UPPMAX HPC cluster</li> </ul> <p>1.12.6.1</p> <p>Type <code>6 + 4 * 9</code> at the Python prompt and hit enter.
