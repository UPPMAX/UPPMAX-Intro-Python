# Lesson plan

 * Intro to Python, day 4 of the 'Intro to UPPMAX' course
 * Teacher: Richel
 * Day: Thursday 2024-01-18

Teaching goals:

 * Learners have used the UPPMAX documentation
 * Learners have used a free and online book they can use for future reference
 * Learners have loaded Python using the module system
 * Learners have used the Python interpreter
 * Learners have seen IPython
 * Learners have seen Jupyter
 * Learners have seen VSCode
 * Learners have used command-line arguments as input
 * Learners have read a file
 * Learners have written to a file
 * Learners feel that Python is something they can do
 * Learners work in small groups
 * Learners have enough breaks
 * Use the fundamental teaching cycle (as discussed in Mike Bell's 'The 
   Fundamentals of Teaching': (1) prior knowledge,
   (2) presention, (3) challenge, (4) feedback, (5) repetition

Non-goals:

 * Discuss as many Python concepts as possible,
   instead follow the group's pace
 * Stick to the schedule about Python theory,
   instead follow the group's pace
 * Practice Python theory enough to master it,
   instead follow the group's pace
 * Tailor to advanced Python developers,
   instead follow the beginners' pace 
   and let the more advanced learners help
 * Teach best practices,
   instead show those best practices
 * Use teaching materials developed by colleagues just to be nice.
   Instead, use free-online teaching materials developed by others,
   so that me and my colleagues do not need to maintain it

Negative feedback that I will enjoy and not respond to:

- 'The course goes too slow': this is an introduction, aimed at beginners.
  The more advanced learners inevitably will find it go too slow.
- 'Lectures are too short': strategic learners will prefer passive listening
  over active teaching methods. Although listening is an activity that
  strategic learners appreciate, it has a too small effect for transferring knowledge.
  I will not feel sorry for putting my learners to work :-)
- 'Go more in-depth': this is an introduction, aimed at beginners,
  so I cover the basics and we get stuff to run. I will go as deep as time
  permits me.
- 'Breaks interrupt the flow': I agree it does. Still, breaks are
  important. And if you feel interrupted in a flow, it is nice to feel
  you like to continue

Negative feedback that I will respond to:

- 'The course goes too fast': this is an introduction, aimed at beginners.
  If even the beginners need more time, I must slow down
