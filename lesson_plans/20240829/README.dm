# Lesson plan

I've already taught using this material once.
The lesson plans are in the top of the material
of each session, hence no need to write it here.

I will use the same exercise procedure as
[https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/teaching/blob/master/exercise_procedures/duos_in_breakout_rooms.md](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/teaching/blob/master/exercise_procedures/duos_in_breakout_rooms.md),
but for groups of 3,
as this worked well on Day 1.
