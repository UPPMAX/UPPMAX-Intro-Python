## Informal evalations

From talking to learners

### Day 1

- Quite fine
- Went a little bit fast in the afternoon
- In the morning, show how to paste text to the remote desktop environment using the clipboard
- Too much content in short time
- If you got stuck, hard time to catch up
- Not put in groups, but working in a group IRL worked
- Force learners to login to Rackham before would help a bit

### Day 2

- From 1 learner:

- It was perfect
- It was useful
- It was fun
- Enough exercises
- Enough breaks

### Day 3

[no informal feedback collected]

### Day 4

- From 1 learner

I had some questions, for example 'What is the interactive node
going to do with my output?'. It is great that we practiced this!

If no video, the teacher cannot see when learners are lost: great idea to turn cameras on for that too!

- Day 1:
    - Should be more hands-on
    - Low tempo
    - More conceptual than technical
    - Move some Day 2 content to Day 1, to be more hands-on
- Day 2:
    - Great!
    - Prefer less in-depth
    - If no experience with Linux, it is hard to keep up.
- Day 3:
    - Douglas: see Day 2
    - Diana:
        - Good day, yet the focus was more on Linux, then making the learners think and be active learners.
        - Less content, e.g only Slurms things that are most important, less Linux flags
- Day 4:
    - lovely
    - fresh
    - kept audience awake
    - As a learner, you do not want to be berated when giving an answer.
     Richel tries to gently deal with a wrong answer and he does this great
    - cameras on is great: else learners feel alone
    - in a gentle way, Richel makes people feel that this is serious:
     there is a schedule, there are exercises and we are going to do it!
    - breaks are great: two hours, 1.5 hours is tough!
    - interrupting an exercise for a break is fine
